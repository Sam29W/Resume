# Resume
Hey there, have a look at my resume here 

Hi, I’m Samith Shivakumar, an aspiring AIML developer currently pursuing my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Jain University (expected graduation: 2027). I’m passionate about building intelligent systems that blend software, creativity, and human-centered design.

My resume reflects a strong foundation in Python, machine learning, AI development, and full-stack web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB. I’ve worked on hands-on projects ranging from smart carts with autonomous navigation to a chatbot system designed to assist students with academic queries. I’m also actively developing a humanoid robot, combining robotics with real-time AI responsiveness.

I enjoy using AI tools—not just passively, but as a creator—building solutions that improve everyday life and push the boundaries of what machines can do. Whether it’s through automation, computer vision, or responsive interfaces, I’m always looking to learn, iterate, and build.

This README exists as part of my digital portfolio. You can explore my resume, GitHub projects, and personal website to see the work I’ve done and the journey I’m on. Always open to internships, collaborations, and good conversations about AI, tech, or just cool ideas.
